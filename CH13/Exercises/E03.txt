/**
 * Suppose that we call scanf as follows:
 *
 * scanf("%d%s%d", &i, s, &j);
 *
 * If the user enters 12abc34 56def78, what will be the
 * values of i, s and j after the call? (Assume that i
 * and j are int variables and s is an array of characters.)
 *
 * scanf first searches for a integer since its first conversion
 * specifier is %d. It recognises the digits till the digit before the first
 * character and copies this digits to i. After the last digit copied to i
 * the %s string conversion specifier see the rest of the characters
 * as a string and copies this to the array of characters char s[].
 * For the last %d there are no characters left and therefore
 * scanf awaits a digit character input which when inputted
 * scanf saves this to j.
