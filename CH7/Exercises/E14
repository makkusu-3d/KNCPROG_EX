/** Does the following statement always compute the
 *  fractional part of f correctly (assuming that
 *  f and frac_part are float variables)?
 *
 *  frac_part = f - (int) f;
 *
 *  If not, what's the problem?
 *
 *  It will not always compute.
 *  int has maximum value of 2,147,483,647
 *  so f values greater then this would cause overflow
 *  which would create random numbers to be subtracted
 *  from f to then be assigned to the identifier of
 *  frac_part
