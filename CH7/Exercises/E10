/** Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is a
 *  variable of type long, and k is a variable of type
 *  unsigned int. What is the type of the expression
 *  i + (int) j * k?
 *
 *  The type for this expression is unsigned int. This
 *  is because j is cast from type long to int. k is of
 *  unsigned int which causes j to be changed to type
 *  unsigned int since it is a operand of multiplication
 *  with operand j. This is now added to i which promotes
 *  i to unsigned int.
