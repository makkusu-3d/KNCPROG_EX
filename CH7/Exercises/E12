/** Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a
 *  variable of type float, and d is a variable of type
 *  double. Explain what conversions take place during
 *  the execution of the following statement:
 *  d = i + f;
 *
 *  First i type int becomes a float due to it being
 *  a operand in a addition operation with the operand
 *  of f which is a float. This expression then becomes
 *  a double type since it is assigned to an identifier
 *  of d which is of type double.
