/** Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a
 *  variable of type float, and d is a variable of
 *  type double. What is the type of the expression
 *  i * f / d
 *
 *  The type for this expression is double. i type int
 *  changes to a float since it is a operand multiplied
 *  by the operand of f which is a float. But since d is
 *  type double, i and f are changed to type double as well.
