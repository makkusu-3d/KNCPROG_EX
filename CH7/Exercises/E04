/** If c is a variable of type char, which one of the
 *  following statements is illegal?
 *
 *  (a) i += c; // i has type int //
 *      This is a legal statement. c becomes type int and is added
 *      to i which is a integer
 *
 *  (b) c = 2 * c - 1;
 *      This is a legal statement. The c in the expression
 *      has the type changed from char to int.
 *      The expression (int type) is evaluated and assigned
 *      as a char type to c. There is a point where there will
 *      be  an overflow is when the c in the expression has a value
 *      larger than 63 this will cause overflow with c since its
 *      maximum value is 127 and give a random value.
 *
 *  (c) putchar(c);
 *      This is a legal statement with the argument of char type
 *
 *  (d) printf(c);
 *      This is a illegal statement. printf only interprets strings where
 *      c is a character type is interpreted as a constant.
