/* For each of the following pairs of scanf format strings,
 * indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent.
 * If they're not, show how they can be distinguished
 */

//  (a) "%d" versus " %d"
//  This is equivalent since scanf will skip the
//  required white-space

//  (b) "%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d -%d"
//  This is not equivalent since scanf will search for a
//  - immediately after the %d and if not found will end
//  the scanf for "%d-%d-%d". Where for "%d -%d -%d"
//  after the %d there is a white-space which allows the
//  string to contain a  indefinite amount of white-space
//  between the integer and the "-"

//  (c) "%f" versus "%f "
//  This is equivalent since scanf will skip the
//  required white-space

//  (d) "%f,%f" versus "%f, %f"
//  This is equivalent since scanf will skip the 
//  required white-space after the comma to the next
//  float
