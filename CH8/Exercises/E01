/* We discussed using the expression
 * sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) to calculate the number
 * of elements in an array. The expression
 * sizeof(a) / sizeof(t), where t is the type of
 * a's elements, would also work, but it's considered
 * an inferior technique. Why?
 *
 * It is hard to interpret the correctness.
 * the reader would have to ensure
 * that the type t is has the same type of the element
 * of a by finding the declaration of array a.
